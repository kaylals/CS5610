Challenges Faced
Throughout the development of the Wordle game app, one of the significant challenges was 
the effective management of state and data flow between components. 
The correct use of props and context to pass data around the application was a complex task
that needed to be addressed. Ensuring that the game logic and state were in sync 
across the game modes (normal and hard) while keeping the codebase clean and maintainable 
required a deep understanding of React's data handling capabilities.

Another challenge was replacing the disruptive JavaScript alert function with 
a more integrated user notification system. This change aimed to enhance 
the user experience by providing feedback that was less intrusive and more 
contextual within the game's interface.

Future Enhancements
Given additional time, there are several features and design changes 
that would significantly benefit the game:
1. Save Game State: Implement functionality to save the game's state in local storage or a backend database to allow players to resume their game after closing the browser.
2. Leaderboard: Create a global leaderboard that records high scores or fastest times for added competition.
3. Daily Challenges: Introduce a daily Wordle challenge to engage users with new words daily.
4. Custom Themes: Allow users to customize the theme of their game board with different colors and fonts.
5. Accessibility Improvements: Enhance the game's accessibility by adding keyboard navigation support and screen reader compatibility.

Assumptions Made
During development, it was assumed that players would have varying levels of 
familiarity with word puzzle games. This assumption guided the design decisions to make the game 
intuitive for new players while still challenging for experienced ones. It was also assumed 
that the game would primarily be a single-player experience without the need for real-time 
multiplayer capabilities.

Duration of Development
The entire process of developing the Wordle game app took approximately 20hours. 
This duration encompassed the planning phase, setting up the project structure, 
developing core functionalities, designing responsive UI components, and implementing the 
state management system using React's Context API and props effectively.
